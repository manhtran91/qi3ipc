Qi3IPC - Qt-based interface for the i3 window manager
=====================================================

Still a WIP.

Motivation
==========

I ran into problems i3ipc-glib with Qt. But the real reason was that I wanted an
exercise in implementing a low-level protocol, which I've never done before.

Features
========

- Modern asynchronous design using Qt's signals and slots

Quick start
===========

Take a look at https://github.com/myrjola/plasmi3bar for how I'm using the
library for an applet in KDE. I still have to write a quick start guide here.
